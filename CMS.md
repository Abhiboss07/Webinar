# Youngness CMS — Phase 1 (Foundation)

This converts the workshop site from a **hardcoded config file** to a **database-driven CMS**
so the client edits content from a browser instead of touching code.

Phase 1 delivers the foundation the rest of the spec builds on:

- **MongoDB** (Atlas) as the content store — none existed before.
- **Admin auth** — email + password, bcrypt hashing, JWT sessions, protected routes.
- **SiteConfig API** — the full website content served from the DB (`GET /api/site-config`)
  and editable by the admin (`PUT /api/site-config`).
- **Migration** — a script that imports every value from `config/workshop-config.js` into the DB
  and verifies a byte-for-byte round-trip (see the report below).
- **Public site wired to the API** — the landing page + thank-you page now fetch content from the
  CMS, with the old config file kept **only as an offline fallback** so the site can never render blank.
- **Admin panel (React + Vite)** — login, dashboard, and a content editor (guided fields + full JSON)
  with autosave and dark mode.

The live **registration + Razorpay + Google Sheets** flow is untouched.

## 2. Database schema

**`users`**

| field | type | notes |
|---|---|---|
| email | String | unique, lowercased, indexed |
| name | String | |
| passwordHash | String | bcrypt, `select:false` (never returned) |
| role | String | `admin` \| `editor` |
| active | Boolean | |
| lastLoginAt | Date | |
| timestamps | | createdAt / updatedAt |

**`siteconfigs`** (singleton — one active document)

| field | type | notes |
|---|---|---|
| key | String | unique, always `"default"` |
| data | Mixed | the full nested content object (same shape as the old config file) |
| updatedBy | ObjectId → User | audit |
| version | Number | bumped on every save |
| timestamps | | createdAt / updatedAt |

> **Why one document now:** the public site already consumes one nested config object, so storing that
> exact shape lets the frontend switch from a file to the API with zero UI risk. **Phase 2** splits the
> hot collections — `Trainer`, `Testimonial`, `Faq`, `Module`, `Benefit`, `Feature`, `Registration`,
> `Media`, `PaymentSettings`, `SeoSettings`, `GoogleSettings` — into their own models with per-item CRUD.
> No secrets are stored in `data` (only values already shipped to the browser).

---

## 3. API endpoints

| Method | Path | Auth | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/health` | — | health check (Render) |
| POST | `/api/auth/login` | — | email+password → JWT (rate-limited) |
| GET | `/api/auth/me` | Bearer | restore session |
| POST | `/api/auth/logout` | — | client drops token |
| GET | `/api/site-config` | — | full website content (public site reads this) |
| PUT | `/api/site-config` | Bearer (admin/editor) | save website content |
| POST | `/register` | — | (unchanged) save pending registration |
| POST | `/create-order` | — | (unchanged) Razorpay order |
| POST | `/verify-payment` | — | (unchanged) verify signature → mark paid |

Auth is a **Bearer JWT** in the `Authorization` header (not cookies), so CSRF does not apply to the
API surface. Security: `helmet`, CORS allow-list, `express-rate-limit`, input validation, bcrypt,
role-based guard, and the Razorpay **secret + sheet token stay server-side only**.

---

## 4. Admin credentials setup

```bash
cd backend
cp .env.example .env         # then fill in MONGODB_URI, JWT_SECRET, ADMIN_EMAIL, ADMIN_PASSWORD, …
npm install
npm run seed:admin           # creates the first admin from ADMIN_EMAIL / ADMIN_PASSWORD
npm run migrate:config       # imports config/workshop-config.js → DB (prints the report)
npm run seed:workshop        # creates the first active Workshop from that content (Module 2.4)
npm start                    # or: npm run dev
```

`seed:admin` is safe to re-run — it resets the password to the current `ADMIN_PASSWORD` (handy if the
client forgets it). Then run the admin panel:

```bash
cd admin
cp .env.example .env          # set VITE_API_BASE to your backend URL (default http://localhost:4000)
npm install
npm run dev                   # http://localhost:5173  → log in with the seeded credentials
```

---

## 5. Deployment

### Backend → Render
1. **MongoDB Atlas**: create a free cluster, add a DB user, allow network access `0.0.0.0/0`
   (Render egress IPs are dynamic), copy the connection string.
2. **Render → New Web Service** from the repo, root `backend/`, build `npm install`, start `npm start`.
3. **Environment** (Render dashboard): `MONGODB_URI`, `JWT_SECRET`, `ADMIN_EMAIL`, `ADMIN_PASSWORD`,
   `RAZORPAY_KEY_ID`, `RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET`, `GOOGLE_SHEET_ENDPOINT`, `SHEET_SHARED_TOKEN`,
   `FRONTEND_URL` (public site URL **and** admin URL, comma-separated), `NODE_ENV=production`.
4. One-time via Render Shell: `npm run seed:admin && npm run migrate:config && npm run seed:workshop`.

### Public site → Hostinger (unchanged process)
- `cd frontend && npm run build:css`, then upload `frontend-production/` (or `frontend/`) static files.
- Set `api.prod` (in `config/workshop-config.js`) to the Render URL — this is still used to resolve
  the API base **and** as the offline fallback content.

### Admin panel → Render Static Site (or Netlify/Vercel/Hostinger subdomain)
- Build command `npm install && npm run build`, publish directory `admin/dist`, root `admin/`.
- Env `VITE_API_BASE=https://<your-render-backend>`.
- Add a SPA rewrite (all paths → `/index.html`) and add the admin origin to the backend `FRONTEND_URL`.

---

## 6. Migration report

`npm run migrate:config` imports the file and **verifies the DB matches it exactly**
(`backend/scripts/migration-report.json`):

```
Top-level sections : 25
Total values       : 347
Round-trip verified: ✓ PASS — DB matches the file exactly
```

Per-section value counts: brand 3 · workshop 8 · api 2 · integrations 3 · payment 38 · seo 6 ·
ctaNote 1 · marquee 2 · header 1 · hero 22 · testimonials 23 · problem 11 · modules 26 ·
whyDifferent 20 · audience 18 · choice 11 · trainer 13 · bonus 22 · guarantee 7 · faq 12 ·
finalCta 6 · footer 13 · sticky 3 · popup 3 · registration 73.

Every one of these values now lives in MongoDB and is served by `GET /api/site-config`. The public
site renders from that response; the old file remains solely as a safety fallback.

---

## Verified in Phase 1

- Migration round-trips 347 values across 25 sections — **PASS**.
- `seed:admin` creates the admin; login rejects wrong passwords (401) and issues a JWT on success.
- `PUT /api/site-config` without a token → **401**; with a token it persists and `GET` reflects it.
- Admin app builds cleanly (Vite, 41 modules).
- Public `config.js`/`app.js` fetch the API and fall back to the bundled file if it's unreachable.

# Phase 2 (in progress)

Order (revised for early client value): **Dashboard → Homepage CMS → Media → Registration Manager →
Workshop Manager → Payments → Users → Settings.**

## Phase 2.1 — Dashboard ✅

Real analytics, backed by a new `Registration` collection that the live sign-up flow now
**dual-writes** to (Google Sheets stays the primary record; the Mongo mirror is best-effort and never
breaks the payment path).

**Data model — `registrations`:** `regId` (unique), contact + profile fields, `source`/`sourceHost`,
`paymentStatus` (Pending/Paid/Failed), `orderId`/`paymentId`/`paymentMethod`/`amount`/`currency`/
`transactionTime`, timestamps. Written by `services/registrationStore.js` from the existing
`/register` and `/verify-payment` controllers.

**API:** `GET /api/stats/dashboard?days=7|14|30|90` (admin) → cards (total / today / pending / paid /
failed / revenue), active workshop, charts (registrations-over-time, payment-status, source-breakdown),
and recent activity. Day buckets are computed in **IST** consistently across the window and the Mongo
grouping, so the time series always reconciles with the totals.

**Admin UI:** stat cards, three dependency-free SVG charts (validated palette, hover tooltips, direct
labels, legends), a recent-activity table, a 7/14/30/90-day range switch, skeleton loaders and empty
states, in both light and dark themes.

**Verified:** auth required (401 without token); card integrity (paid+pending+failed==total, revenue ==
Σ paid×price); `Σ(series) == count(in-window)`; dual-write captures a lead even when the Sheets write
fails; admin builds clean.

## Phase 2.2 — Homepage CMS ✅

Per-section control over the homepage, plus a proper **draft → preview → publish** workflow with
version history — all inside the existing `SiteConfig` model (no duplicate structures).

**Section manifest, not duplicated content:** `data.sections` is an ordered `[{key, enabled}]` list that
*references* the existing content keys. `backend/config/sections.js` is the canonical list of the 12 real
body sections (hero, testimonials, problem, modules, whyDifferent, audience, choice, trainer, bonus,
guarantee, faq, finalCta) with friendly labels; `normalizeManifest()` seeds/repairs it non-destructively.

**Draft / publish:** `data` = published (what the public serves), `draft` = the admin's working copy
(autosave target), `history` = capped snapshots for revert.

**API added:** `GET /api/site-config?preview=1` (draft for Preview), `GET /api/site-config/draft`,
`PUT /api/site-config` (now saves the **draft**), `POST /api/site-config/publish`,
`POST /api/site-config/discard`, `GET /api/site-config/history`, `POST /api/site-config/revert`.

**Public site:** `frontend/js/app.js` renders body sections in manifest order, honouring `enabled` and
the footer toggle, skipping any section with no renderer/content; `?preview=1` loads the draft. Missing
manifest → historical default order (fully backward compatible). Synced to `frontend-production`.

**Admin:** new **Homepage Sections** page (drag-and-drop reorder, enable/disable switches, footer toggle,
live "N of 12 enabled" validation); a shared **PublishBar** (autosave status, Preview, Discard, Publish,
Version history → Restore) driven by a `DraftProvider` that the Content editor now also uses.

**Database changes:** `siteconfigs` gains `draft`, `history[]` (capped 15), `publishedAt`,
`draftUpdatedAt`. No new collection.

**Verified (18/18 e2e assertions):** auth guards; manifest normalization (12 sections); draft isolation
(public shows published while preview shows draft); reorder + disable persist through publish; history
snapshot + `hasDraft` reset; validation 400s; discard restores published; revert restores an older
snapshot; frontend/backend section order confirmed identical.

**Known limitations:** section content is edited on the Content page (guided fields + JSON) — dedicated
per-item editors (add/edit/delete individual trainers, FAQs, modules) are a later slice; Preview needs
`VITE_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` set; charts/section UI still need a human eyeball in a browser (no browser in the
build environment).

## Phase 2.3 — Media Library ✅

A full Cloudinary-backed media manager behind a **provider abstraction**, so it also runs on local disk
in dev (no secrets needed) and Cloudinary drops in for production via env.

**Storage abstraction:** `services/storage/index.js` selects `cloudinaryAdapter` (prod) or `localAdapter`
(dev/fallback) from `STORAGE_PROVIDER`. Local files are served at `<API_URL>/uploads/…`; Cloudinary
returns CDN URLs with `f_auto,q_auto` optimisation and a 300×300 thumbnail transformation.

**Model — `media`:** provider, publicId, url/secureUrl/thumbUrl, resourceType (image/video/raw), format,
bytes, width/height, originalFilename, folder, altText, tags[], `checksum` (sha256 dedupe), uploadedBy.

**APIs added:** `GET /api/media` (search / type + folder filter / paginate, with live usage counts),
`POST /api/media` (multipart upload, dedupe), `GET /api/media/:id`, `PATCH /api/media/:id`
(alt/folder/tags), `POST /api/media/:id/replace` (swap file **and rewrite the URL everywhere it's used**
across published + draft), `DELETE /api/media/:id` (blocked with 409 if in use unless `?force=1`).
Static `/uploads` route for the local adapter.

**Admin:** Media Library page — drag-and-drop upload with per-file progress, **client-side image
optimisation** before upload, search/type/folder filters, grid with thumbnails + usage badges +
dimensions + size, an asset modal (preview, edit alt/folder/tags, copy URL, replace, delete),
pagination. A reusable **MediaField** now backs the Logo / Hero image / OG image fields in the Content
editor — pick from the library instead of pasting URLs. Existing string paths keep working.

**Database changes:** new `media` collection (indexes on publicId, checksum, resourceType, folder).

**Verified (24/24 e2e + static serve):** auth guard; upload with real dimension/size/checksum; **dedupe**
(same bytes → same asset); unsupported-type 400; pdf → raw; search + type/folder filters; **usage count**
from live content; patch; **replace propagates** the new URL into the draft; delete guard (409 → force);
`/uploads` serves the file (`200 image/png`); Cloudinary adapter rejects cleanly when unconfigured; admin
builds clean (49 modules).

**Known limitations:** local adapter does no server-side resize (Cloudinary does in prod; the admin still
downsizes large images client-side); Cloudinary paths need real credentials to exercise here; browser
eyeball of the grid/dropzone still pending (no browser in build env).

## Phase 2.4 — Workshop Manager ✅

Workshops become first-class, cloneable entities. A `Workshop.content` **overlays** the site-wide
`SiteConfig` base — the public `/api/site-config` composes `{ …base, …activeWorkshop.content }` (workshop
owns `workshop`, `hero`, `seo`, `registration`, `modules`, `faq`, `testimonials`, `trainer`, `bonus`,
`gallery`…), while brand/footer/section-manifest stay site-wide.

**Safety:** with no active workshop the endpoint returns today's output unchanged; the migration
(`seed:workshop`) creates one active workshop that mirrors the current content **exactly**, so the
composed output is byte-identical (verified). Overlay only replaces keys the workshop defines, so partial
workshops fall back to the base.

**Model — `workshops`:** title, subtitle, description, slug (unique), category, `status`
(draft/published/archived), `isActive` (one live workshop), `scheduledFor` (delayed go-live), `content`
(overlay), timestamps.

**APIs added:** `GET/POST /api/workshops`, `GET/PUT/DELETE /api/workshops/:id`,
`POST /api/workshops/:id/{duplicate,activate,status}`. Public `GET /api/site-config?workshop=<slug>`
previews any (even draft) workshop; the site forwards `?preview=1&workshop=` from the URL.

**Admin:** Workshops list (status/active badges, filters, New/Edit/Duplicate/Publish/Unpublish/Activate/
Archive/Restore/Delete/Preview) and a tabbed editor (General · Schedule · Registration · Media · SEO ·
Advanced JSON) with autosave, Media picker for banner/trainer/gallery.

**Database changes:** new `workshops` collection (indexes: slug, status, isActive). No changes to existing
collections; registration/payment/Sheets untouched.

**Verified (22/22 e2e):** auth guard; seeded active/published/live workshop; **composed == base
(byte-identical)**; draft preview via `?workshop=`; create/slug/validation; publish→activate switches the
live workshop and deactivates the old; duplicate; delete-active guard (409); archive → safe fallback;
reactivate; future-`scheduledFor` not served until its time; migration idempotent; admin builds (52 mod).

**Known limitations:** arrays (agenda/modules, faq, testimonials, certificates, sponsors) are edited via
the Advanced JSON tab for now — dedicated per-item editors come later; per-workshop draft-vs-published
dual copies aren't implemented (status + `?workshop=` preview cover the workflow); no cron for scheduled
publish (go-live is computed at read time, which is sufficient).

## Roadmap — remaining modules (revised order)

**2.5 Registration Manager** (search/filter/sort/CSV+Excel/status/bulk on the `Registration` model) ·
**2.6 Payment Manager** · **2.7 Analytics** · **2.8 User Management** · **2.9 Settings** (incl. a
**Theme & Branding** section: logo, favicon, colours, fonts, contact, social, footer) · **2.10 Form
Builder** (client adds registration fields — Hospital Name, License Number… — without code, rendered on
the form and stored per-registration) · **2.11 Email & WhatsApp Templates** · **2.12 Backup / Audit Logs**.

Homepage CMS with per-section enable/disable + drag-reorder + preview; **Media Manager** on Cloudinary;
**Registration Manager** (search/filter/sort/CSV+Excel/status/bulk — built on the `Registration` model
above); **Workshop Manager** (multiple workshops, active-workshop selection); **Payments** view; **Users**
& roles; and a consolidated **Settings** screen. UI polish: glassmorphism, animations, pagination,
confirmation dialogs.
```
